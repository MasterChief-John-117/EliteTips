# Engineering Materials

Engineering Materials, commonly called mats, are used for engineering, synthesis, and unlocking modules at tech brokers. The Grade of a material is an indicator of its rarity, a higher G mat will be less common. Once you have enough credits to be comfortable, it's reccomended you look for missions that offer G4/5 mats.

### Material Caps

Materials don't take up space in your cargo hold. They exist in their own space without mass, so pick them up whenever you can. Once again, [inara](https://inara.cz) is super useful for knowing what mats you need and where/how to find them.

> G1 mats = 300  
> G2 mats = 250  
> G3 mats = 200  
> G4 mats = 150  
> G5 mats = 100  

### Material Farming

While you can obviously go around finding materials the regular way, it's often a bit tedious. Here are some sites to make it quicker

Important note: **Industrial** bases will give you bounties and fines. Avoid them for this. I prefer Scientific bases.
